# covid-19-tracker
Script for tracking covid-19 cases and trend by country

I wrote this script on my iPhone using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/python-programming-interpreter/id1335895307" target="_blank">Python Programming Interpreter</a> app.

# Input
The input is specified in input.txt

Second tab (Input) on the bottom.

Just type in the from_date e.g. 2020-03-30 to filter only most recent data.

# Run
Execute the script with the green arrow in the top right corner.

The Output tab renders the data by country:
1. Confirmed cases by date
2. Difference in confirmed cases since previous day
3. Arrow up/down for trend. (Confirmed cases)
4. Deaths by date
5. Difference in deaths since previous day
6. Arrow up/down for trend. (Deaths)

Regarding the trend. 
If difference is bigger than in the previous day the trend is up.
If difference is less than in the previous day the trend is down.
